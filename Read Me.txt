DATA
-----
The Emotions for NLP dataset was used for this project. Acquired from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp


RUNNING THE MODELS
-------------------
There is a single file (nc_coursework.ipynb) which contains preprocessing, both models used (MLP and SVM), evaluation, optimisation, and final predictions. 


FOR TAâ€™S -> For ease of testing and final model evaluation of pre-trained models, test.ipynb has been included. This shows the same testing methodologies seen in nc_coursework.ipynb.
